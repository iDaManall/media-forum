The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Users can customize the interface of the web app

## Notes

Use npm start for the project in a test environment. Will also need a client.js file with api key and url. For this project supabase was used.

The most notable challenges were figuring out the comment feature and working around storing image addresses instead of image objects as of right now. Will probably improve upon it in the future when more time is available.
